# Blockchain Crowdfunding Platform

## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --contract --template hardhat-javascript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `contracts/Contract.sol`.

To add functionality to your contracts, you can use the `@thirdweb-dev/contracts` package, which provides base contracts and extensions to inherit. The package is already installed with this project. Head to our [Contracts Extensions Docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit) to learn more.

## Building the Project

After making any changes to the contract, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will compile your contracts and detect any contract extensions.

## Deploying Contracts

When you're ready to deploy your contracts, run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run deploy
# or
yarn deploy
```

## Releasing Contracts

To release a version of your contracts publicly, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run release
# or
yarn release
```
